```

Imagine you have set of points, but you know only distances between them 
(distances for all their possible pairs). *dist2location* package can be used 
to find the location of all points. 

Of course there are infinity solutions in cartesian coordinate system 
(with some big enough k dimension) but it's enough to find one. Rest of them 
can be found by symmetry transformation, rotation or shifting points by vector. 

# Distance Matrix concept
One of the basic concept used during working with *dist2location* package is 
*distance matrix*. For set of n points enumerated by {1,2, ..., n} distance 
matrix is built as square matrix with n rows and columns. Row (and column) with 
index i is related with i-th point. Matrix element indexed by (i,j) includes 
distance between i-th and j-th points. 

Of course distance from i-th to j-th point should be equal to distance from 
j-th to i-th point (opposite direction) so upper and lower triangle matrices 
should be symmetrical. Additionally diagonal should include only zeros, because 
distance between point and itself is 0. There are more limitations related with 
metrics, see chapter "Validation distance matrix". 

## Example 1
Let's consider pythagorean triangle with edges lengths 3,4 and 5. 

![](Example1.PNG)

If we enumerate three vertices  A, B, C as 1,2,3 following distance matrix 
describes distances between them:
```{r}
matrix(c(0,3,4,
        3,0,5,
        4,5,0),3,3)

```

## Example 2
Let's consider tetrahedron (triangular pyramid where all edges have the same 
length). In this example we assume edge length is equal to 7. For such 
symmetrical case it doesn't matter how do we enumerate vertices, distance 
matrix is defined for them as: 
```{r}
matrix(c(0,7,7,7,
        7,0,7,7,
        7,7,0,7,
        7,7,7,0),4,4)
```
# Distance Matrix validation 
Distance matrix should be a square matrix and no NA nor negative values should 
be included. Additionally three axioms defined for metric space should be 
fulfilled (lets denote d(x,y) as distance between points x and y):

1. d(x,y) = 0  <=> x = y
2. d(x,y) = d(y,x)
3. d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z) , so informally: "direct" distance from x to z is 
not bigger then distance from x to z via point y.

Function *is_distance_matrix_ok()* can be used for validation:
```{r}
library(dist2location)
m_ok <- matrix(c(0,7,7,7,
                 7,0,7,7,
                 7,7,0,7,
                 7,7,7,0),4,4)

is_distance_matrix_ok(m_ok)
m_rule2_broken <- matrix(c(0,7,7,7,
                           2,0,7,7,
                           7,7,0,7,
                           7,7,7,0),4,4)
is_distance_matrix_ok(m_rule2_broken)
```
If we want to check what is wrong with second matrix, there is also function 
for debuging:
```{r}
debug_distance_matrix(m_rule2_broken)
```
